So after organizing Pittsburgh Perl Workshops, Monger meetings, and now YAPC|10 it occurs to me that many talks die with out a sound.
What I mean is I have heard good ideas for talks but they never happen for many reasons: 
	- no time to prepare 
	- no expertise
	- interested in topic but not enough to do the talk
	- etc

Sometimes a novice would like to see a talk but does not know who to ask or what to do.  
Sometimes a pro sees a good talk topic but does not do the talk.

Basically this repo is inted to try to keep some talks from dieing quietly.

I will start:

one with more detail


See it does not have to be much.  It can be just a seed..  Maybe it will grow into something maybe it won't.  But if you don't plant it, it will NEVER grow.
